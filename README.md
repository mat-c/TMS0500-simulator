# ti59 and TMC0501 microcode simulator

This project allow to run microcode for TMC0501 generation calculator.
See http://www.datamath.org/Chips/TMS0500-CS.htm for more information

This is based of previous work from Hynek Sladký :
- http://hsl.wz.cz/ti\_59.htm
- https://www.hrastprogrammer.com/emulators.htm

The goal is to able to run microcode of several calculator and understand
how the differents chips work together.

For that each chip is implemented in a separate file and communicate with
bus like shared data.


## How to use it

build (only tested on linux)
```
make
```

download firmware
```
./bin/get_rom.sh
```

run the selected model

```
./bin/SR50.sh
```

```
./bin/ti59.sh
```

Key mapping is print on startup

You can check doc dir for more technical information.

### printer
you can pass option "-p" to enable printer

```
./bin/ti59.sh -p
```

### CROM
you can pass option "-l" to load master lib

```
./bin/ti59.sh -p -l rom/module-lib/TMC0541.txt
```
You can test it using
"2nd Pgm 01"
"SBR ="

It should print
```
MASTER
1
```
and display "1"

Additionnal library module can be found on

### Debug

#### log
You can enable log in log.txt file

- '-v level'
  - level=1 : low
  - level=3 : medium
  - level=7 : high

#### ROM

You can disassemble on stderr the rom with '-d' option

```
./bin/ti59.sh -d
```
```
./bin/SR52.sh -d
```

#### CROM

You can disassemble on stderr the rom with '-D' option

```
./bin/ti59.sh -l rom/module-lib/TMC0541.txt -D
```
